 * 100 points
 * Build a PokemonBattle game/main method. 
   * Two players will alternate turns.
   * First each player will choose a Pokemon
   * Then the two players would alternate entering commands to attack (fastAttack or specialAttack or pass). 
    * A player must "pass" three times to build up energy for a specialAttack.
   * You'll have to build a way to check for a Pokemon reaching 0 HP. That will signal the end of the game, with the other player as the winner.
